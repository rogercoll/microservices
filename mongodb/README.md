#  Example of Microservices in Go with Docker and MongoDB

Requirements
===========

* Docker 1.12
* Docker Compose 1.8

We must **add virtual domains** in order to use each **api entry point**. By default we are using: **movies.local**, **bookings.local**, **users.local** and **showtimes.local**

**Virtual domains** has been defined in `docker-compose.yml` file and configured in `/etc/hosts` file. Add the following line in your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1   movies.local bookings.local users.local showtimes.local
```

Starting services
==============================

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Stoping services
==============================

```
docker-compose stop
```

Including new changes
==============================

If you need change some source code you can deploy it typing:

```
docker-compose build
```

Restore database information
======================

You can start using an empty database for all microservices, but if you want you can restore a preconfigured data following this steps:

**_Access to mongodb container typing:_**

```
docker exec -it cinema-db /bin/bash
```

**_Restore data typing:_**

```
/backup/restore.sh
```

**_Leave the container:_**

```
exit
```


Documentation
